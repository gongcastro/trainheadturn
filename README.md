# trainheadturn
Training for on-line looking time coding using the Head-turn Preference Procedure in infants.
The check function compares the performance of trainee with the performance of a proficient experimenter measuring looking times in the same infant.
The workflow should be as follows: 1) proficient experimenter measures on-line looking times of an infant using WISP software and stores the postprocessed results as a .txt file, 2) trainee measures looking times of the same infant from the video recording and stores the postprocessed results as a .txt in the same directory as the previous experimenter did, 3) execute the function in R specifying the infant's ID, 4) analyze the performance of the trainee.
